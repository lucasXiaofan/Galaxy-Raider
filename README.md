2. Add the **2020.3.32f1** Unity version
3. Install [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (or your preferred IDE that supports C#)
4. Set Visual Studio (or your preferred IDE) as your default IDE in Unity

###### Git & Github GUIs:

## Project Branching Structure
- `main` - this is the “production-ready” branch of the project. All presentable PRs should be merged into this branch upon code review & approval with Team Lead (Lucas)
- All other “branches” are considered “work-in-progress” until they are reviewed and approved to be merged into `main`

## Project Branching & Merging Process
1. Clone the Galaxy Raider repository
2. Pull current main branch to run locally on our machine
3. When you’d like to commit and push your work, push it onto an appropriately named branch (**NOT** `main`)
    - For example if you are working on an implementation of the inventory system, you can name your branch `inventory-system`.
4. Notify the Team Lead, Lucas, that you’ve completed your task so he can start a code review. The possible outcomes of code review are:
    - Edit Request - You may be asked to modified some part of your code to ensure it works with the rest of the game
    - Team Lead Edit - Lucas may make changes to the code before pushing it to main
    - The PR is approved, and it gets merged onto the main branch. Everyone can pull from this branch to have access to whatever feature you completed.
5. Read Steps 3 & 4 again!! This is absolutely important to prevent merge conflicts.
